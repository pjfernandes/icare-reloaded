This is a Ruby on Rails app (fullstack framework) created for hiring caregivers.

1) There are 4 data models: caregiver, client, order and user. The files are in app/models. Database schema is in icare_db.png

2) Backend files are in app/controllers, app/models and in many other folders

3) Frontend files are in app/views (html.erb files). These files allow devs to put ruby code in HTML files

4) The app also uses javascript libs for text animation (typed.js) and for map implementation (mapbox API)

5) App was developed based in the prototype available in Figma: <https://www.figma.com/file/LXzKQtDwJ3DDDZD5I0APhk/iCare-(SENAC)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=cRUTNIHp29362wvg-1> and <https://www.figma.com/proto/LXzKQtDwJ3DDDZD5I0APhk/iCare-(SENAC)?type=design&node-id=1-2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A114>
